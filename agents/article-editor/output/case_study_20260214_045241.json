    "original_text": "Responsible AI: The Urgency Is Real, but the World Is Not Lost\nA PractitionerÕs Take on Why We Need to Act NowÑWithout the Panic\nBy Sunil Iyer | February 2026\n---\nI have been working in AI governance for a while now, and if there is one thing I have learned, it is this: the people who understand AI the best are the ones who worry about it the most. Not in a doom-and-gloom, the-robots-are-coming kind of way. More in a quiet, thoughtful, I-can-see-where-this-is-headed kind of way.\nThe February 2026 International AI Safety Report, led by Turing Award winner Yoshua Bengio and backed by over 100 experts from more than 30 countries, laid it out plainly. General-purpose AI capabilities have continued to improve rapidly, especially in mathematics, coding, and autonomous operation. In 2025, leading AI systems achieved gold-medal performance on International Mathematical Olympiad questions and exceeded PhD-level expert performance on science benchmarks. That is extraordinary progress. It is also the kind of progress that demands equally extraordinary responsibility.\nSo Is the World in Peril?\nNo. But it could be if we are not careful.\nLet me explain what I mean. The risks of AI are not some distant, science-fiction scenario. They are happening right now. Deepfakes are being used to manipulate elections and defraud businesses. Algorithmic bias is affecting hiring decisions, loan approvals, and criminal sentencing. AI-driven cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticatedÑAnthropic disclosed in late 2025 that a state-sponsored attack used AI agents to execute 80 to 90 percent of the operation independently, at speeds no human hacker could match. Underground marketplaces now sell pre-packaged AI tools that lower the skill threshold for cybercrime.\nAnd then there is the environmental cost. Global data center electricity consumption is projected to exceed 1,000 terawatt-hours by 2026. Training a single large language model can emit hundreds of tons of CO?. These are real numbers with real consequences.\nThe Gap Between Progress and Governance\nHere is what keeps me up at night. AI capabilities are advancing at an exponential pace, but our governance frameworks are crawling along. The EU AI Act is in effect, yes, but the standards needed to implement its high-risk rules are still being developed. The timeline has slipped. Enforcement is uncertain. And that is the EUÑthe most proactive regulatory body on the planet when it comes to AI.\nIn North America, the picture is even more fragmented. The US has no comprehensive federal AI legislation. Canada is making progress, but slowly. Meanwhile, AI adoption is accelerating in every industry, across every function. The gap between what AI can do and what our rules say it should do is widening every single day.\nThe All Tech Is Human Responsible AI Impact Report put it well when it identified the defining question for the years ahead: who determines the purpose of AI and the kinds of lives it will shape? That is not a rhetorical question. It is a governance question, a policy question, and frankly, a deeply personal question for anyone working in this space.\nWhat Responsible AI Actually Looks Like in Practice\nI will tell you what responsible AI does not look like. It does not look like a principles document that sits in a shared drive and collects digital dust. It does not look like a one-time ethics review at the beginning of a project. And it definitely does not look like checking a compliance box and calling it a day.\nResponsible AI, in my experience, looks like this. It looks like a fraud detection team asking, before deploying a new model, whether it disproportionately flags claims from certain demographics. It looks like a product team running bias audits on their chatbotÕs responses. It looks like a data scientist documenting not just what their model does, but what it cannot do and where it might fail. It looks like leadership saying, ÒWe would rather be slower and right than fast and wrong.Ó\nThe International AI Safety Report recommends a defense-in-depth approachÑlayering multiple safeguards so that if one fails, others catch the problem. That makes sense in theory. In practice, it means investing in model evaluations, technical safeguards, monitoring systems, incident response protocols, and most importantly, the people who operate all of these things.\nThe Case for Urgency Without Panic\nI want to be clear about something. The urgency around responsible AI is real. We are at an inflection point. The decisions being made right nowÑin boardrooms, in government offices, in research labsÑwill shape the trajectory of this technology for decades. If we get governance right, AI could be the most powerful tool for human flourishing that our species has ever created. If we get it wrong, the harms will be profound and difficult to reverse.\nBut the world is not in peril. Not yet. We have time, but not unlimited time. The frameworks exist. The expertise exists. The will to do the right thing exists in more places than the headlines would have you believe. What we need now is actionÑnot perfect action, but consistent, thoughtful, collaborative action. Start with your own organization. Build the governance structures. Ask the hard questions. And do not wait for someone else to go first.\n\n",
