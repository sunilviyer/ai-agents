    "original_text": "Five AI Agents, One Portfolio: What I Learned Building My Own AI Team\nA Non-DeveloperÕs Journey into Agentic AI\nBy Sunil Iyer | February 2026\n---\nI am going to let you in on something. I am not a developer by training. I have spent over 15 years in insurance, currently working as a Solution Consultant and Senior Manager for Customer Success at Shift Technology, an AI-first fraud detection company. My world has been client service, technology innovation, AI governance, and helping insurers fight fraud with artificial intelligence. But over the past year, I taught myself to build things I never thought I could. Specifically, I built five AI agents. And I want to tell you about them, because I think the lessons extend far beyond my personal portfolio.\nEach agent is a distinct AI personality with a specific job. They live on my portfolio website at suniliyer.ca, and each one represents a different facet of what agentic AI can do in the real world. I gave them names, personalities, and even little robot avatars with their own color schemes. If you have seen the rest of my portfolio, you might think itÕs less frivolous. I think it makes the technology approachable.\nScout: The Fraud Trends Investigator\nScout is the one closest to my day job. This agent is designed to do deep research on global insurance fraud patterns. You give it a topicÑsay, staged accident fraud in North America, or data sharing practices across insurersÑand it executes a multi-step workflow. First, it plans a research strategy. Then it searches industry sources like publications, reports, and case studies. Next, it queries regulatory databases, government reports, and compliance documents. After that, it extracts and organizes the findings. Finally, it synthesizes everything into a comprehensive report with an executive summary, confidence score, and data freshness indicator.\nThe workflow is inspired by how I actually conduct investigations. The difference is that Scout can do in minutes what would take me days. It is not replacing the investigatorÕs judgmentÑit is augmenting it.\nTicker: The Stock Monitor\nTicker watches financial markets. It scans for news, events, and sentiment around specific stocks or sectors. When something significant happensÑa merger announcement, a regulatory change, an earnings surpriseÑTicker classifies the event, assesses its potential impact, and generates an alert. Think of it as a personal financial news analyst that never sleeps.\nI built Ticker because I am an active investor and I got tired of sifting through noise to find signal. The agent does not make investment decisions for me. It gives me a curated, assessed feed so I can make better decisions faster.\nMatcher: The Home Finder\nThis one is personal. My family has been exploring the real estate market, and anyone who has looked for a home knows how exhausting it can be. Matcher takes your criteriaÑlocation, budget, size, features, proximity to schools or transitÑand searches, filters, enriches, and ranks properties. It does not just find listings. It finds matches. It pulls in neighborhood data, price history, and comparable sales to give you a much richer picture than a basic search filter.\nQuill: The Article Editor\nQuill is my writing partner. As someone who writes about AI governance, responsible AI, and industry trends, I spend a lot of time drafting articles and internal documents. Quill takes a rough draft, analyzes its structure and tone, researches relevant references and supporting data, and enhances the writing while keeping my voice intact. It is like having a very talented editor on call who also happens to be an excellent researcher.\nThe key thing about Quill is that it does not rewrite my work. It polishes it. It adds citations I might have missed. It suggests stronger openings. It flags inconsistencies. But the ideas and the voice stay mine. That distinction matters a lot to me.\nSage: The Bhagavad Gita Guide\nSage is the one that is much closer to my heart. It is a conversational AI that teaches the wisdom of the Bhagavad Gita. You can ask it about any conceptÑdharma, detachment, the nature of the selfÑand it responds with relevant verses in transliterated Sanskrit with English translation, contextual explanation, and practical application for modern life.\nI built Sage because the Gita has been a profound influence on how I think about decision-making, leadership, and purpose. ArjunaÕs crisis on the battlefieldÑfrozen between duty and love, unable to actÑis something every leader faces in their own way. I wanted to make that wisdom accessible through technology. Sage is the only agent that is live and interactive on my site. You can actually type a question and have a conversation with it. The others showcase their workflows through animated demonstrations.\nWhat I Learned\nBuilding these five agents over the past year, investing hundreds of hours learning Next.js, React, Flask, PostgreSQL, and local LLMs, taught me something that no certification or course could have. It taught me that the barrier to building with AI is lower than most people think, and the ceiling is higher than most people imagine.\nI am not a coder by profession. I used AI tools to help me code. I used Claude to help me debug. I used the BMAD methodology to structure my development process. I iterated relentlesslyÑmy Seshan Financial Dashboard went through four complete iterations over 280-plus hours before I was satisfied. And through all of it, I learned that the most valuable skill in the AI era is not knowing how to code. It is knowing what to build and why it matters.\nIf you are a non-technical professional reading this and thinking you cannot do something similar, you are wrong. You can. Start with a problem you care about. Use the AI tools available to you. Learn in public. Make mistakes. Iterate. The agents in my portfolio are not perfect. But they are mine, and each one represents a real problem I wanted to solve. That is what makes them valuableÑnot the technology, but the intent behind it.\n",
