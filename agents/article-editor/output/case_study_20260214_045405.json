    "original_text": "Seshan: What 280 Hours of Building Taught Me About AI, Learning, and Letting Go of Perfection\nThe Story Behind the Dashboard That Changed How I Think\nBy Sunil Iyer | February 2026\n---\nSeshan started as a spreadsheet problem.\nLike a lot of people who take their finances seriously, I had a messy collection of brokerage statements, RRSP contribution records, stock purchase histories, and dividend trackers spread across multiple files and platforms. I wanted a single dashboard where I could see everythingÑreal-time market data, portfolio performance, asset allocation, and AI-powered analysisÑall in one place. So I decided to build one.\nI should mention: when I started this project, I did not know JavaScript. I had never used React. I had no idea what Next.js was. Flask was something you brought on a hiking trip. PostgreSQL sounded like a medical condition. I am a Solution Consultant at an AI-first insurtech company. My technical background was in setting up technology to solve business problems, not building it from scratch. As anyone, who has deployed a SaaS product can attest too, sometimes it is just too generic for the need. This inflexibility has always frustrated me and while I became an expert is workarounds, I wanted something solid, something structural. \nThe First Iteration: Chaos and Caffeine\nThe first version of Seshan was, to put it charitably, a mess. I was learning everything from scratchÑhow to set up a development environment, how to structure a full-stack application, what a REST API actually does. I spent entire evenings just trying to get a database connection working. My wife started making jokes about my new best friend being a terminal window.\nBut something clicked. Every small victoryÑa database query returning the right data, a chart rendering correctly, an API endpoint actually respondingÑfelt like a genuine accomplishment. I was hooked. Not on the technology itself, but on the process of solving a problem that mattered to me personally.\nIterations Two Through Four: The Real Education\nOver the next several months, I rebuilt Seshan from the ground up three more times. Each iteration was fundamentally different from the last. I switched frameworks. I redesigned the database schema. I learned about the BMAD methodology and used it to structure my development process. I set up a Neon PostgreSQL database for cloud hosting. I integrated real-time market data feeds. I added portfolio tracking with support for partial stock sales, dividend reinvestments, and multi-currency holdings.\nBy the third iteration, I was writing code that I was not embarrassed by. By the fourth, I had something I was genuinely proud of. The final version features real-time market data, comprehensive portfolio tracking, AI-powered analysis, and a clean interface that actually looked professional.

Spread across evenings and weekends over the better part of a year. Was it efficient? Absolutely not. Was it worth it? Without question.\nSeshan Intelligence: The Privacy-First Experiment\nOnce the dashboard was working, I got curious about something. Could I build an AI-powered financial analysis tool that ran entirely on my local machine? No cloud. No data leaving my laptop. Complete privacy.\nThat curiosity became Seshan Intelligence. I used Ollama to run a local Llama 3.2B model and built a Next.js frontend that lets you interact with the AI to analyze your portfolio. Ask it about concentration risks. Ask it to stress-test your allocation against a recession scenario. Ask it to compare your holdings against sector benchmarks. All of it runs locally, which means your financial data never touches a third-party server.\nThis mattered to me because I work in an industry where data privacy is paramount. If I am going to advocate for responsible AI at work, I should be building responsibly at home too.\nWhat the Journey Taught Me\nThe biggest lesson from Seshan is not about technology. It is about learning itself. I discovered that the best way to learn something complex is to attach it to a problem you genuinely care about. I did not learn PostgreSQL because I wanted to learn PostgreSQL. I learned it because I needed a database to track my investments. I did not learn React because it was on some skills roadmap. I learned it because I wanted a beautiful, responsive interface for my dashboard.\nThe second lesson is about iteration. My first version was embarrassing. My second was mediocre. My third was decent. My fourth was good. If I had stopped at any point before the fourth, I would not have the portfolio piece I have today. The willingness to throw away work and start overÑnot tweak, but genuinely start overÑis the most underrated skill in learning anything new.\nThe third lesson is about AI as a learning accelerator. I used Claude extensively throughout the development process. Not to write my code for me, but to explain concepts I did not understand, debug issues I could not figure out, and suggest approaches I had not considered. It was like having a patient, infinitely available tutor who never judged me for asking the same question three different ways. If you are a non-technical person trying to learn to build things, AI is the greatest learning tool that has ever existed. Full stop.\nWhy I Am Sharing This\nI am sharing the Seshan story because I think there is a narrative gap in the AI conversation. Most of the articles you read about AI are written by engineers, researchers, or journalists. They are about what the technology can do. There are far fewer stories about what ordinary professionalsÑpeople with jobs and families and limited free timeÑcan do with the technology when they decide to learn.\nSeshan is on my portfolio at suniliyer.ca not because it is the most sophisticated financial dashboard ever built.
